Leaders who believe that they can achieve organizational goals using just one leadership style will not succeed. The most effective leaders learn how to flexibly adapt multiple leadership styles to guide their employees, achieve their goals, and build strong teams. <br /> A popular management theory called Situational Leadership, first developed in 1969 by Dr. Paul Hersey and Kenneth Blanchard, remains especially relevant in today’s business environment. This theory is based on the premise that because organizations are not made up of workers who are equally skilled and motivated, leaders should manage team members according to their individual abilities and developmental readiness. We’ll review their method, and then suggest some ways you can use it to manage today’s business challenges.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Accreditation</strong></p><p>0.25 hours, Continuing Education Units (CEU) from the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM)</p><p>0.25 hours, Continuing Education Units (CEU) from the HR Certificate Institute (HRCI)</p>",

Sometimes that involves changing processes, adopting new technologies, or learning new skills. What do you do when one or more of your employees refuse to change and grow with the rest of the team? People tend to approach change in one of the two ways. They either embrace change and are excited about the possibilities and opportunities inherent in a new adventure.

This is especially important where teams comprise different temperaments and behaviors which can cause disagreements, resentment or stress. The presence of differences should not be our main focus but rather how best to work together despite differences. In this course psychologist Eve Ash explains how we can improve communication, respect and caring by creating and maintaining PEACE, a five part strategy. Focusing on the PEACE approach is an important way to improve how we work together, to change competition or even conflict into collaborative problem-solving.</p>",

Sam recommends setting meeting goals, and having a specific time frame for each agenda item. The team learn to respond to flagging energy levels, respect meeting rules and respect each other.</p><p>Learn that the schedule, purpose and agenda of a meeting should be clear, participants should be prepared and everyone should participate. Meetings should start and end on time, and follow up actions should be clearly stated and agreed. Learn that valuing peoples input and encouraging constructive behavior makes for an improved meeting atmosphere as does summarizing key points and listing actions as you go.</p><p> </p><h3>Key Learning Points</h3><ul><li>Don’t meet without clear goals INSTEAD: Set agenda and control time</li><li>Don’t lose group energy INSTEAD: Make it engaging</li><li>Don’t cultivate negativity INSTEAD: Manage conflict respectfully</li><li>Don’t leave loose ends INSTEAD: Ensure actions and outcomes<br /><br /></li></ul><h3>Comedy makes learning fun</h3><p>This interactive course is part of the popular Cutting Edge Communication Comedy Series created by Psychologist Eve Ash and comedienne Erin Brown starring Emmy-award winning Kim Estes.

More and more organizations use virtual teams to meet corporate goals. This has created the need to determine how best to manage and lead these virtual groups. \n Traditional methods of managing on-site groups don’t work with remote workers, because virtual teams are most often composed of workers who are spread over a varied geographic and cultural expanse and communicate, for the most part, electronically. Future Workforce Report states that 63 percent of companies utilize virtual workers, but only 57 percent have standards in place to manage the process. \n In this lesson, you will learn to effectively guide teams that they rarely see face-to-face.</p><br /><p><strong>Accreditation</strong></p><p>0.25 hours, Continuing Education Units (CEU) from the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM)</p><p>0.25 hours, Continuing Education Units (CEU) from the HR Certificate Institute (HRCI)</p>",

Your role as the leader of a high-performing team is to provide the training, resources, coaching, and support they need—as individuals and as a team—so that they can grow in their abilities, and perform as efficiently and dynamically as possible. Because of today’s constantly evolving business environment, every individual, regardless of position or experience, needs ongoing training and coaching. Knowing which tools, training opportunities, and coaching methods work for each individual is critical. Research by Accenture found that 31% of employees left their jobs because they don’t like their boss; another 31% cited lack of empowerment as their reason for leaving.

The factors influencing this energy level can be either intrinsic or extrinsic. In this lesson, you will learn about both intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation and how to leverage them. \n How do you motivate your team to do their best? You give them the tools, trust, and time to make their jobs personal. You provide enough challenge for them to work at facilitating better, but not so hard that they become discouraged.

                                "description": "<p>In our guide<strong> resumes still rule – make sure yours isn’t rejected</strong> we talked about why a resume still plays a vital role in recruitment, now we want to show you how to create one that pushes all the right buttons.</p><h2>TAKE THE TIME TO MAKE YOUR RESUME PERFECT</h2><p>Your resume is a marketing document designed to achieve one clear objective: secure an interview. Despite the arrival of new recruitment technologies and methods, a strong resume is still the most commonly requested document in the job search process.</p><p>Yet they’re often written in haste because candidates view them as an onerous part of the process. That means spending more time writing yours and thinking carefully about what should be in it, can put you one step ahead of the competition.</p><p>There’s no one-size-fits-all way to do it, but there are commonly accepted resume writing rules that everyone should follow. In this guide we share these and help you focus on the right things.</p><h2>PICK THE BEST STRUCTURE FOR YOU</h2><p>Resumes are usually in a chronological or functional format.</p><p>Chronological resumes are the most common. They list experience by employer, showing the time spent at each, starting with the most recent role. For people looking for work in a similar field to the one they are in, who want to highlight their experience, it’s the one to go for.</p><p>A functional resume groups and highlights specific capabilities, bringing together information by skill type rather than employer. This format is useful if you’re considering a career change or have a specific skillset (such as technical, medical or engineering skills) that a potential employer would want to know about in more depth.</p><h2>KEEP IT SHORT, SWEET AND INSTEP WITH THE INTERNET</h2><p>Your resume shouldn’t be longer than two A4 pages unless you work in a specific sector that expects more detail (and there aren’t many of those). The objective is to secure an interview, you can expand on the information you’ve provided when you’re there. So be concise.</p><p>Also take a bit of time to make sure your online profile complements your resume and creates a positive impression. Check dates align on sites such as LinkedIn – where you can also go into more detail about your experience than on your resume – and hide any social media posts that might damage your personal brand. </p><h2>TARGET YOUR RESUME</h2><p>You should have a compelling resume on hand to share with anyone who wants to know more about you. But when you’re applying for a specific job you need to make it as relevant to the role as you can. This means researching the organization you’re applying to, reflecting on the skills and experience they need and shaping your resume to fit with what you think the recruiter wants to see.</p><p>If you already have a resume it’ll probably just need small adjustments to draw out the experience most relevant to the position. Imagine you’re the recruiter or hiring manager – what would you want to see and how can you align with that?</p><p>When you research the company think about when you’ve worked in that type of environment before. If it is large multi-national organization and that matches your experience, say so. For example:</p><p><em>Experience of navigating and getting things done in a large multi-country, multi-cultural environment.</em><br /><br />Having said that, targeting your resume doesn’t mean you should make up skills and experience to fit the role. That’ll trip you up somewhere along the line. Likewise don’t copy and paste large chunks of content from the job advert into your resume, it looks lazy.</p><h2>DON’T FORGET THE ROBOTS</h2><p>As we’ve mentioned in other guides, the ease and accessibility the internet has brought to the jobs market has dramatically increased the number of applicants per role. And recruiters are turning to technology for help. This means your resume is likely to be analyzed by an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) or screening robot.</p><p>These systems will categorize and rank applicants for their suitability for a role. The top ten or 20 matches will then be screened by a human who will create a shortlist to interview.</p><p>An ATS or robot divides a resume into smaller chunks and scans for key words. They’re not perfect but their accuracy is improving and they’re not going away, so you need to write your resume with a robot in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Keep your format clean and simple. </strong>Remove graphics, images, tables and logos.</li><li><strong>Use keywords from the job description. </strong>But don’t copy and paste the whole thing.</li><li><strong>Match titles from current and previous roles </strong>to those referenced in the job description.</li><li><strong>Submit in a common format</strong>, such as Word or PDF.</li></ul><h3><br />NOW, LET’S LOOK AT EACH SECTION OF A CHRONOLOGICAL RESUME IN DETAIL</h3><p><strong>Your profile or situation summary</strong><br />If your resume beats the applicant tracking systems (ATS) and finds itself in front of a human, this might be the only section they read. So make it count. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Avoid clichés and hyperbole</strong>. Keep it factual and concise.</li><li><strong>Think about what an employer needs. </strong>Describe your profession, specialist skills and a couple of professional characteristics.</li><li><strong>Include key words. </strong>A recruiter, and an ATS, will look for these.</li><li><strong>Avoid common skills. </strong>Such as Word, Excel and Powerpoint, unless they have been specifically asked for.</li><li><strong>Go easy on soft skills. </strong>You can demonstrate these at an interview, a resume should highlight hard skills.</li></ul><p>Here’s an example of a good summary:</p><p><em>MBA qualified </em><em><strong>Operations Manager </strong></em><em>with 10 years of experience in retail banking and insurance. Innovative and practical approach to process re-engineering and a skilled negotiator with strong people management and leadership capabilities. Looking to secure a leadership role in the financial services sector that offers exposure to IT transformation initiatives that improve customer service and efficiency. </em></p><p><em><strong>Key skills include:</strong></em></p><p><em>* Operational Improvement * Project Management * Strategic Planning * Leadership Skills * IT Transformation * Risk and Compliance * Stakeholder Management * Budget Management</em></p><p><strong>Education</strong><br />List education and qualifications in reverse chronological order. If you have applied for a role as an accountant and are a fully qualified chartered accountant (CA) with a degree in accounting, list the CA qualification first and the degree second. Only include relevant qualifications – recruiters looking for accountants don’t need to know you’re also a qualified street dance instructor.</p><p>Remember the first half of the first page of your resume is the most important, so if you have more than two items of education you need to include, consider moving them below your work achievements, so they’re not overlooked.</p><p><strong>Work history</strong><br />As with education, detail your current or most recent role first. This works better with an ATS and means your recent relevant experience is most prominent.</p><p>Start with your job title, the company name, its location, and your dates of employment including the months. If your company isn’t well known, add a sentence explaining who they are and their size. Now link your skills with your achievements in the role, by showing a positive result followed by how you achieved it. For example:</p><p><strong><em>National Sales Manager</em></strong></p><p><em>ABC INC. Melbourne, Australia</em><br /><em>Jan 2014 – Current</em></p><p><em>A global bio tech employing 300+ people specializing in drugs for patients suffering life-threatening cases of melanoma and other terminal cancers.</em></p><ul><li><em>Doubled annual revenue for the local affiliate and produced $7M in sales in the first year by conducting a robust territory analysis and implementing a focused sales strategy.</em></li><li><em>Grew the team from four to eight territory managers in 2015 in direct response to expanding the portfolio into both specialists and hospitals.</em></li></ul><p><strong>Personal interests</strong><br />Lots of people include this section but it’s unlikely to help secure you an interview. In fact, it can be detrimental to your chances if it triggers subconscious bias in a recruiter. If your personal interests have a direct link to the role you are applying for then include them (a passion for photography and art would be useful to a photographer’s assistant) otherwise leave them out.</p><p><strong>Awards and affiliations</strong><br />Only include them if they’re less than three years old, are directly relevant to the role and will be easily recognized by a recruiter.</p><p><strong>References</strong><br />There’s no need to include them or waste space writing ‘available on request’. A recruiter will assume this.</p><p><strong>Write, edit and edit again</strong></p><p>Once you’ve decided what should be in your resume you need to make sure you deliver it in a way that’s compelling and easy to understand. Always bear in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Spelling mistakes are lethal</strong>. According to CareerBuilder, 61% of recruiters will automatically reject a resume with typos. Don’t rely on spell check, ask friends to proofread it for you.</li><li><strong>Don’t overuse adjectives. </strong>Filling your resume with terms such as ‘inspirational leader’, ‘highly motivated’, ‘skilled communicator’, ‘pro-active mindset’ won’t impress anyone, in fact they’re more likely to put them off. Instead provide examples of an activity or initiative you were involved in that demonstrates each of these qualities.</li><li><strong>Ditch company jargon. </strong>Use commonly understood industry titles and references. Your company might call human resources ‘people capital’ but an ATS or recruiter might not know what you’re talking about.</li><li><strong>Be consistent with your tense. </strong>Select either first person or third person and stick with it.</li><li><strong>Use simple formatting. </strong>Whatever style and structure you select make it consistent and don’t get too creative. Unnecessary swirls, logos, italics or underlining make it harder for readers to pick out information.</li><li><strong>Don’t be economical with the truth. </strong>As tempting as is to overstate your skills, it’s a waste of everybody’s time if you can’t back it up at an interview.</li></ul><p>Now, go back and read it one more time.</p><h3>FIVE THINGS TO REMEMBER:</h3><ol><li>Check, re-check and check again for spelling, grammar and layout consistency</li><li>Keep it concise. Two pages is usually enough.</li><li>Target your resume for specific roles and companies.</li><li>Ensure your digital profile aligns with your resume.</li><li>Don’t think of it as a chore. This can change your life – it’s worth a little time.</li></ol><h3>MORE TOOLS AND GUIDES:</h3><ul><li>Check the quality of your resume using an evaluation and scoring tool like<a href=\"http://rezscore.com/\"> Rezscore.com</a>. The report it provides might not be 100% accurate for the country you are in, but it will certainly be a great starting point and give you some guidance on where you could make some improvements.</li></ul>",

                                "description": "<p>LinkedIn is the dominant professional networking site – it has around 500 million users and is where recruiters often begin their search for new staff – so it goes without saying (but we’ll say it) you need to have a LinkedIn profile. Once you’ve got a great looking LinkedIn profile one you need to make sure it’s working hard for you.</p><h2>FIND OUT WHY LINKEDIN IS IMPORTANT FOR THE MODERN JOB SEEKER</h2><p>In this guide we cover the ‘must do’ actions to create a LinkedIn profile that will get you noticed as well as advice on kickstarting your networking activity.</p><h2>SOME THINGS TO CONSIDER WHEN CREATING YOUR PROFILE</h2><p>Good recruiters will be proactively searching for talent online, which means devoting time to getting your profile right could cut how long it takes you to find a new position. Employers will often get in touch with suitable candidates on LinkedIn before a job has been advertised or an application made, so you need to make yours stands out. Here are some tips:</p><p><strong>Start brilliantly</strong>. View your profile as other users would and make sure that everything they can see when they first land on it entices them keep scrolling down.</p><p><strong>Perfect your headline. </strong>Not only is this at the top of your page (see previous point) your name and headline are what recruiters see when they search for you on LinkedIn or in Google. Unless you manually edit your headline it will default to your current job title and company. Change it to include different industry recognized titles and bring to life what you do. So rather than ‘HR director for NuVenture Ltd’ try: ‘HR director, talent manager, HR leader, change manager, HR business partner, supporting 4,000 employees across North America in the IT services sector’.</p><p><strong>Now work on your summary. </strong>Also one of first things people see, your summary should be concise but include four to six bullet points of key attributes, skills and experience. It should also bring to life areas of focus and passion.</p><p><strong>Mix up your media. </strong>Rather than relying on text in the summary, consider including documents you might have written, relevant photos, research papers or articles and videos. LinkedIn’s Professional Portfolio tool can help you.</p><p><strong>Keep using keywords. </strong>Many recruitment tools and recruiters use keywords when searching the internet for talent. Applying effective search engine optimization tactics to your LinkedIn profile will help people interested in your skills find you. At the very least your keywords should include your industry, location, company names and specialist skills. Ensure your keywords are used frequently and consistently throughout your headline, job titles, summary and skill descriptions.</p><p><strong>Do your research. </strong>Look at job adverts in your area of expertise and note down the hard skills employers are regularly looking for. Although each advert may be phrased differently, they could be targeting the same skills, so think how one skill can be described in several ways and include them all in your profile if you can. For example, one company might be looking for a human resources professional with recruitment experience, but another might be looking for talent acquisition expertise. In this case, it would be wise to include both as key words and phrases. LinkedIn’s Insights tool can also help you identify important keywords.</p><p><strong>Ask contacts for endorsements. </strong>Your skills will rank higher in search results, if other people have endorsed you for those skills.</p><p><strong>Say cheese. </strong>Although you shouldn’t use pictures on your resume, always add one to your LinkedIn profile. Studies have shown profiles with a photo are 30% more likely to be clicked on. If you can, get a headshot taken by a photographer, otherwise choose one of you looking professional rather than a selfie on the beach.</p><p><strong>Customize your LinkedIn URL</strong>. If you don’t, you’ll be allocated a random mix of letters and numbers that will look messy on your resume. If you can, customize the URL to as close to your full name as possible.</p><p><strong>Get recommendations </strong>from previous colleagues and managers. If appropriate, ask them to include some of your keywords. You can only ask for recommendations from people who are first degree contacts, offering them one in return is a good way to make it worth their while.</p><p><strong>Review your privacy settings. </strong>If you’re looking for new career opportunities you should make your profile as public as possible, even if it’s just for the duration of your job hunt. The more you share on LinkedIn the more likely recruiters are to find you. If you are updating your profile with a view to getting a new job it’s worth bearing in mind that your connections, including current colleagues, will be notified of your profile edits unless you turn this feature off.</p><p><strong>Consider upgrading </strong>to a premium account during your job search. A premium account allows you to connect directly with individuals and gives you access to tools that increase your visibility in searches. It costs around USD $30 per month, unless you’re eligible for a free trial.</p><h2>NOW, MAKE SURE YOUR PROFILE COMPLEMENTS YOUR RESUME</h2><p>Your resume should be targeted at the specific job you are applying for, focusing on experience relevant to that position. Your LinkedIn profile, on the other hand, aims to promote your general professional brand. But they should be consistent with each other in terms of dates and roles held.</p><p>LinkedIn gives you the chance to expand on details in your resume. You can explain the scope of your current and previous roles, the status and strategic priorities of the businesses, what you focused on and the kind of environments you worked in. In your resume you should focus more on outcomes that demonstrate skills you’ll need for a specific role.</p><p>A good recruiter will be reviewing your online profile before committing to an interview or further evaluation, so it’s vital you don’t give them any reasons to doubt you. If an employer looks you up online, you want to make sure that what they see clearly demonstrates who you are and what you can offer. It’s a good idea to keep your social media accounts private just in case there is anything on them that might damage your professional brand.</p><h2>BE ACTIVE AND BUILD YOUR NETWORK</h2><p>Just having a great LinkedIn profile may not be enough. You need to engage with like-minded professionals and companies to keep growing your network.</p><p>The more connections you have the more often you will appear in search results as a second or third degree connection. One prerequisite of a 100% complete profile is to have at least 50 connections – LinkedIn says a complete profile appears in a search on average 40 times more than an complete one, as well as featuring higher up the results.</p><p>If you are setting up your profile for the first time, allow LinkedIn to access your contacts and identify who is already on the site. Also review the ‘people you may know’ suggestions that LinkedIn provides and send an invite to connect where appropriate.</p><p>You can also expand your LinkedIn network by:</p><ul><li><strong>Joining and actively contributing to industry groups. </strong>By being an active member of your network, you will be first and foremost in the minds of employers when the time is right.</li><li><strong>Network offline. </strong>Be active in the physical world, meeting people at conferences and industry events and connecting afterwards.</li><li><strong>Post your activity on LinkedIn </strong>so your network can see what events you are attending. If you are hosting one, they may share it with their connections.</li><li><strong>Be nosy</strong>. Look up other people in your industry and compare profiles. Could yours be improved? They are likely to check out your profile in return – if you have a premium account you’ll be able to see who has viewed your profile.</li><li><strong>Share content</strong>. Write or share relevant articles and content and comment on posts within your professional community. If you are consistently appearing in your connections’ feeds they’ll remember you when an opportunity arises.</li></ul><h2>BUT PAUSE BEFORE YOU START POSTING</h2><p>Take a moment before promoting yourself online to check your profile is credible and think about how a recruiter might react to a post before posting it. Employers will judge you based on your online activity. But get it right and you might find a job comes to you before anybody else knows about it.</p><h3>FIVE THINGS TO REMEMBER:</h3><ol><li>Your LinkedIn profile needs to be current and complete</li><li>Add specific keywords and phrases</li><li>Treat the first page of your profile as prime real estate</li><li>Nail your headline</li><li>Keep building your networks</li></ol>",

It should be used to improve your performance in the future. If your job involves sales, managing budgets and production, your success can usually be measured in numbers. So, a Feedback Mechanism will be an indicator that highlights your performance in numbers. \nWhat if you are a leader? Your performance could be judged on more abstract terms such as how your interpersonal skills are evolving. If you are a leader, often the main source of feedback will be through performance reviews and sources of this information will come from your manager and your peers. Keep in mind this feedback promotes personal and professional growth. There may be positive and negative feedback but always keep in mind that these are just our indicators and will help us to improve. Remember also that the feedback mechanism is a two-way process. As a leader you give feedback to your team and you will also encourage your team members to open up and voice their opinions about your leadership. Note that you should always make arrangements to have regular feedback sessions.\nToday, we will be learning different ways to obtain feedback on your performance in the workplace and understanding the importance of feedback mechanisms. \nOnce the session is completed, you will be able to define the meaning of a feedback mechanism, identify the different ways of getting feedback on performance in the workplace and explain the importance of a feedback mechanisms in leadership and team building.",

Well... not exactly.

But delegating does not mean dumping personal responsibility on to others. Delegating tasks can lighten your workload. There is a proverb that says, “The more heads working together, the better”. Because we both know we have unique skills. There are things you can do that others can’t do and vice versa. Delegating tasks allows team members to learn new skills and develop a sense of responsibility. Employees who feel that they are trusted and respected tend to have a higher level of commitment to their work, their organisation, and, especially, their managers. Remember that delegating empowers your team and builds trust.\nOnce the session is completed, you will be able to define the meaning of delegation, identify tips in delegating tasks effectively and adopt the strategies leaders must use to delegate tasks effectively for the success of the team.",

Giving negative feedback to your team can be tricky. You need to make it constructive. You’re looking for improvements so don’t ignore problems hoping they will sort themselves out. There are several types of feedback but today, we will focus on constructive feedback. So, what is constructive feedback? Constructive feedback is supportive feedback given to individuals to help identify solutions to areas of weakness they may have. Therefore, it comes with positive intentions and is used as a supportive communication tool to address specific issues or concerns. Remember that the best way to approach telling someone about their work or even behaviour is to be direct and make sure it’s about work or behaviour, not in any way personal. \nOnce the session is completed, you will be able to explain the meaning of constructive feedback, identify the tips in giving constructive feedback and employ effective constructive feedback techniques for the team and for successful leadership.",

Because communication errors create tension and are a waste of energy, the ability to communicate well is an essential skill that everyone must cultivate carefully. It is important for the person transmitting information to convey a clear, unambiguous message correctly, and for the receiver to facilitate the transmission, providing feedback on the way the message is perceived, and making sure that the information is complete.

Why do we prefer to hire a candidate who is similar to us, even though we might miss out on a rare gem? Quite simply because our reasoning is disturbed by cognitive bias in daily life. To break free of these mechanisms, we need to understand them. If you can recognise yourself in these examples, then this training course is for you!",

Coaching is always task oriented whereas mentoring is relationship oriented. It is all about reaching a stage where the mentor can easily share the real issues influencing the trainee.

Identifying strengths and weaknesses and getting the best from individuals to achieve better results. It is about improving performance, and the quicker it happens, the better. A good coach knows what is required to do a job well, not just well but to exceed expectations. \nTo do that, a leader must be willing to pay attention to the details and identify what are good and bad techniques. If staff happen to make mistakes then offer training solutions. It is important to keep records of what is being said within your team. The actions carried out and the plan to put in place. This helps you track any progress and the records you keep are useful for evaluation and follow up meetings. \nImportantly, you must turn this process into a positive about improving performance, not finding faults.\nOnce the session is completed, you will be able to describe good coaching techniques, identify reasons why employees fail to perform and solutions to the problems. Also, you’ll be able to provide a list of key points to achieve a better environment for the team.",

He decides to investigate on the sly… Step into the shoes of the famous colonel and use your critical thinking skills to question the 5 suspects and solve this strange case, where everyone can use fallacious arguments or are prone to cognitive biases, wittingly or not… Don't forget: you have to solve at least 3 interviews to be able to unmask the culprit.

As older leaders begin to retire at greater rates, the 2018 Deloitte Millennial Survey discovered that 65% of potential millennial leaders feel unprepared to take their places. Forbes reports that by 2025, 75% of the workforce will be made up of millennials. These statistics suggest that there’s a leadership crisis on the horizon. Designing a strategy and framework to direct leadership development is mission critical for every organization. Training—and retaining —emerging leaders in your company should be a top priority.

If you want to achieve goals consistently, build strong, collaborative teams, and establish solid relationships with colleagues, superiors, and clients, then you need Emotional Intelligence. Emotional Intelligence, also known as Emotional Quotient (EQ) is the ability to properly gauge your emotions as well as the emotions of others in all situations, use proper judgement and behave appropriately for the desired outcome. In other words, EQ is the ability to identify your emotions, and those of others, and use that knowledge to make the best decisions, regardless of the circumstances.",

Team briefings are essential and bring benefits to the team. They prevent rumours spreading. They are also designed to bring teams together, discuss issues and increase productivity in the workplace. \nThe team leader should focus on the performance of the team. Motivate your team members with praise. Remember, all meetings and briefings should of course be two-way. The team must actively listen as much as talk. Make it as fun as possible. \nOnce the session is completed, you will be able to define team briefings, identify key points to talk about during briefings, and create actions for successful team briefings.",

This entertaining interactive course will provide an excellent opportunity for users to build and develop their communication skills required at work.</p><p> </p><p>The team at Cutting Edge have decided that Carol needs to work on her EQ (emotional intelligence) skills. Steve and Sam run training for the staff. Carol thinks no such training is called for. Sanjay has problems with his emotions being quick to snap at colleagues and denigrate their work. Dion advocates reading peoples body language and being sensitive to their needs. Casey is the eternal victim of Sanjays anger and Barney encroaches on Serena's personal space. Dion and Sherry attempt a role-play which gets out of hand. Serena the VP still manages not to notice other peoples reactions. Marcus breaks up an argument by praising everyones efforts at growing and developing their EQ. Marcus praises everyones efforts at the end of the session. Steve and Sam decide that Carol is more of a TORmentor than a mentor.</p><p> </p><h3>Key Learning Points</h3><p>Seek to understand feelings and emotions.

Establishing a culture of continuous learning in your organization takes time and effort, but the results are worth the investment. \n Begin with gaining the support of executives, and then start to incorporate learning into your overall mission, your strategic goals, and value statements. \n Work to get “buy-in” from everyone in your company, and include them in finding ways to learn, teach, and share knowledge. \n Establish easy-to-use systems and processes that make learning an expected part of your corporate behavior. \n Your organization and employees will benefit not only through increased productivity and higher profits, but in personal development and job satisfaction as well.</p><br /><p><strong>Accreditation</strong></p><p>0.25 hours, Continuing Education Units (CEU) from the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM)\n</p><p>0.25 hours, Continuing Education Units (CEU) from the HR Certificate Institute (HRCI)</p>",

You will have learned to accept what you cannot control, and define the problem by examining the facts. This helps you to adjust to the situation so you can plan a pathway forward with the facts you’ve assembled. Then you can thrive in creative ways and help others to do so as well.</p>",

Differences of opinion and different ways of working can undermine unity and team success. Working together builds enthusiasm, familiarity and trust. It creates a sense of belonging and unity of purpose. </p><p>In this course psychologist Eve Ash outlines how you can UNITE your team of individuals to achieve great outcomes in the workplace. A united team delivers better results than any individual member acting alone. Successful teamwork involves genuine collaboration and open communication. This produces more ideas, more creativity and greater innovation. Being engaged as a team increases focus and efficiency. Uplift and inspire the people you work with. UNITE your team using five strategies.</p>",
