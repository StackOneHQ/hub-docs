StackOne is a unified API used by B2B SaaS companies to add native 3rd party integrations to their
product. As a white-label embedded integration platform, StackOne operates in the background,
managing the integration within your vendorâ€™s system. This allows you to connect effortlessly with
the solution providers you already use directly through your vendor's interface.
