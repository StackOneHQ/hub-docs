- Cascade HR does not provide a dedicated API endpoint to retrieve a list of departments or teams or locations.
- These lists are also not directly available in the Cascade HR UI. While departments can be found in the Payroll module, 
  there is currently no API access to retrieve them from there.
- As a workaround, we have used the Hierarchy endpoint, which returns the organisation's full hierarchy structure. This endpoint
  provides a list of nodes, each containing a Level that defines the node's Level (depth) within the hierarchy.
- According to the [Cascade HR service guide](https://help-iris.co.uk/hr/cascade/api/serviceguides/hierarchy-overview.htm), 
  hierarchy nodes represent different group types, such as locations, departments, and teams.

- To fetch departments, teams and locations, need to specify **depHierarchyLevel**, **teamHierarchyLevel** and **locationHierarchyLevel** when connecting 
  their account. These values indicate which levels in their organisational hierarchy correspond to departments,teams and locations respectively.

        <img className='rounded-md' style={{ margin: '0 auto', border: '1px solid #efefef' }} alt="Hierarchy Level" src="/images/cascadehr/image3.png" />
    </Frame>
- Using these specified levels, we extract the relevant nodes from the hierarchy response to return the appropriate list of departments and 
  teams and locations.

 <Note>
  If you do not provide one of the hierarchy levels (locationHierarchyLevel, depHierarchyLevel, or teamHierarchyLevel), you will not be able to retrieve the corresponding resource.
