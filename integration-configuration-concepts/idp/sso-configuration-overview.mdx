This guide provides an overview of configuring Single Sign-On (SSO) attributes for LMS integrations. Custom SSO attributes, such as `lms_user_id`, allow you to map user identities between your identity provider and Learning Management System (LMS) platforms.

## What are Custom SSO Attributes?

Custom SSO attributes are additional user data fields that are passed from your Identity Provider (IDP) to your LMS during the SSO authentication process. These attributes enable:

- **User Identity Mapping**: Link users between your IDP and LMS using custom identifiers
- **Role Assignment**: Automatically assign roles or permissions based on user attributes
- **Group Membership**: Map users to appropriate groups or organizational units
- **Profile Enrichment**: Pass additional user information like department, manager, or job title

## Common Use Cases for LMS Integrations

### Learning Management Systems
When integrating with LMS platforms, you typically need to configure custom attributes to:

1. **Map User Identities**: Each LMS may require a different user identifier format
2. **Assign Learning Paths**: Route users to appropriate training based on their role or department
3. **Track Compliance**: Ensure users complete required training based on their job function
4. **Reporting and Analytics**: Provide detailed reporting based on organizational structure

### Typical Attribute Requirements
Most LMS integrations require at least one custom attribute for user identification:

- **`lms_user_id`**: Primary identifier for the user in the LMS
- **`employee_id`**: Corporate employee identifier
- **`department`**: User's organizational department
- **`role`** or **`job_title`**: User's position for role-based access
- **`manager_email`**: Manager information for approval workflows

## Configuration Steps Overview

While each Identity Provider has its own interface and terminology, the general process follows these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Required Attributes">
    Determine what custom attributes your LMS integration needs:
    - Check your LMS documentation or integration requirements
    - Common attributes include user ID, email, employee ID, department, role
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure User Attributes">
    Set up the required custom attributes in your Identity Provider:
    - Create custom user fields if needed
    - Populate existing user profiles with the required data
    - Map attributes to appropriate user properties
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure SSO Application">
    Set up your LMS application in your Identity Provider:
    - Configure SAML settings (Entity ID, ACS URL, etc.)
    - Map user attributes to SAML assertions or claims
    - Set up attribute statements with the correct names and values
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Configuration">
    Verify that your SSO configuration works correctly:
    - Test with a sample user account
    - Check that all required attributes are being passed
    - Verify attribute values are formatted correctly
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure LMS Integration">
    Map the SSO attributes to your LMS integration:
    - Specify which SSO attributes correspond to LMS fields
    - Configure role mappings and group assignments
    - Test the complete integration flow
  </Step>
</Steps>

## LMS-Specific Considerations

Different LMS platforms have varying requirements for SSO attributes:

### Popular LMS Platforms

**Docebo**
- Primary identifier: Usually email or username
- Additional attributes: First name, last name, role, groups
- Format: Standard SAML attributes

**Cornerstone OnDemand**
- Primary identifier: Employee ID or custom identifier
- Additional attributes: Manager, department, location
- Format: May require specific attribute names

**SAP SuccessFactors**
- Primary identifier: Username or email-based identifier
- Additional attributes: Job title, organization unit
- Format: SAML assertions with specific formatting

**Workday Learning**
- Primary identifier: Employee ID or custom identifier  
- Additional attributes: Manager, cost center, location
- Format: SAML or SCIM-based provisioning

**360Learning**
- Primary identifier: Email address
- Additional attributes: First name, last name, team
- Format: Standard SAML attributes

## Best Practices

### Security Considerations
- **Minimize Attribute Exposure**: Only pass attributes that are necessary for the integration
- **Use Secure Protocols**: Ensure all SSO communications use HTTPS and proper certificate validation
- **Regular Audits**: Review and audit SSO configurations and attribute mappings regularly
- **Access Controls**: Implement proper access controls for SSO application management

### Data Management
- **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent attribute naming conventions across integrations
- **Data Quality**: Ensure user profiles have complete and accurate data for required attributes
- **Change Management**: Implement processes for handling changes to user attributes
- **Backup Strategy**: Maintain backups of SSO configurations and user attribute mappings

### Testing and Monitoring
- **Regular Testing**: Test SSO flows regularly, especially after configuration changes
- **Monitor Logs**: Review SSO authentication logs for errors or issues
- **User Feedback**: Collect feedback from users about SSO experience and any issues
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor SSO performance and response times

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Attribute Not Passed
- Verify attribute is configured in IDP
- Check that user has value for the attribute
- Confirm attribute mapping syntax is correct

### Incorrect Attribute Format
- Review LMS documentation for required format
- Check IDP attribute transformation rules
- Verify data type compatibility

### User Not Found in LMS
- Confirm primary identifier attribute is correct
- Check that user exists in both IDP and LMS
- Verify attribute value matches between systems

### Permission Denied
- Check user has access to the SSO application
- Verify group memberships and role assignments
- Review conditional access policies
