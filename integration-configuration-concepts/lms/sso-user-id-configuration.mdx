## Overview

When integrating Learning Management Systems (LMS) with StackOne, you often need to configure a custom Single Sign-On (SSO) attribute called `lms_user_id` in your Identity Provider (IDP). This attribute maps to the specific user identifier required by your LMS platform and ensures users are correctly identified during authentication.

## Why LMS User ID Mapping is Important

Different LMS platforms use various user identification schemes:

- **Email-based systems**: Use email addresses as primary identifiers
- **Employee ID systems**: Use corporate employee identifiers
- **Username systems**: Use login usernames or aliases
- **External ID systems**: Use third-party system identifiers
- **Auto-generated IDs**: Use platform-specific unique identifiers

The `lms_user_id` attribute allows you to map your IDP's user data to the specific identifier format expected by your LMS.

## Supported Identity Providers

StackOne supports SSO configuration for the most popular enterprise Identity Providers:

### Enterprise IDPs
- **[Okta](/integration-configuration-concepts/lms/okta-sso-configuration)** - Configure custom user attributes and SAML/OIDC mappings
- **[Azure AD/Entra ID](/integration-configuration-concepts/lms/azure-ad-sso-configuration)** - Use extension attributes and claims configuration
- **[OneLogin](/integration-configuration-concepts/lms/onelogin-sso-configuration)** - Set up custom user fields and parameter mappings

### Cloud-Based IDPs
- **[Google Workspace](/integration-configuration-concepts/lms/google-workspace-sso-configuration)** - Create custom attributes and SAML mappings
- **[Auth0](/integration-configuration-concepts/lms/auth0-sso-configuration)** - Use metadata and custom claims configuration

## Common Configuration Patterns

### SAML Configuration
For SAML-based integrations, you'll typically:

1. **Create a custom user attribute** in your IDP
2. **Populate the attribute** with LMS-specific user identifiers
3. **Configure attribute statements** in your SAML application
4. **Map the attribute** to the `lms_user_id` claim
5. **Test the configuration** to ensure proper token generation

### OIDC Configuration
For OIDC-based integrations, you'll typically:

1. **Create user metadata** or custom fields in your IDP
2. **Set user-specific values** for the LMS identifier
3. **Configure custom claims** in ID tokens or access tokens
4. **Use rules or actions** to dynamically map attributes
5. **Test token content** to verify claim presence

## LMS-Specific Requirements

Each LMS may have specific requirements for user identification:

<Note>
  **Important**: Always consult your specific LMS integration documentation to determine the correct user identifier format and mapping requirements.

### Common Identifier Types

| LMS Type | Common Identifier | Example Value |
|----------|------------------|---------------|
| Corporate LMS | Employee ID | `EMP-12345` |
| Educational LMS | Student ID | `STU-67890` |
| SaaS LMS | Email Address | `user@company.com` |
| Custom LMS | External System ID | `EXT-ABC123` |
| Multi-tenant LMS | Tenant + User ID | `tenant1:user123` |

## Implementation Workflow

1. **Identify LMS Requirements**
   - Determine the user identifier format your LMS expects
   - Understand whether the identifier should be static or dynamic
   - Check if multiple identifiers are supported

2. **Choose Your IDP Configuration Method**
   - Select the appropriate Identity Provider from our supported list
   - Follow the specific configuration guide for your IDP
   - Consider using existing user attributes vs. creating custom fields

3. **Configure User Mappings**
   - Set up the `lms_user_id` attribute or claim in your IDP
   - Populate user profiles with the correct LMS identifiers
   - Configure SAML/OIDC applications with proper attribute mappings

4. **Test Integration**
   - Use your IDP's testing tools to verify token/assertion content
   - Perform end-to-end SSO testing with your LMS
   - Validate that users can successfully authenticate and access appropriate content

5. **Deploy and Monitor**
   - Roll out the configuration to all LMS users
   - Monitor authentication logs for any issues
   - Set up processes for updating user mappings as needed

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Attribute Not Appearing in Tokens
- Verify the custom attribute is properly configured in your IDP
- Check that users have the attribute populated
- Ensure SAML/OIDC application includes the attribute in mappings
- Review IDP logs for any configuration errors

### Authentication Failures
- Confirm LMS expects the specific attribute name you're sending
- Verify the attribute value format matches LMS requirements
- Check that users are assigned to the correct application
- Review both IDP and LMS authentication logs

### User Profile Mismatches
- Ensure the `lms_user_id` value correctly identifies the user in the LMS
- Verify there are no duplicate or conflicting identifiers
- Check that the LMS user provisioning process handles the identifier correctly
- Consider case sensitivity and special character requirements

## Best Practices

### Security Considerations
- Store sensitive user identifiers in secure metadata fields when possible
- Use app_metadata instead of user_metadata for non-user-editable data
- Implement proper access controls for IDP configuration changes
- Regularly audit user attribute mappings for accuracy

### Maintenance
- Document your user identifier mapping strategy
- Set up automated processes for bulk user updates when possible
- Monitor for authentication failures and user mapping issues
- Plan for LMS migration scenarios where identifiers might change

### Testing
- Always test SSO configuration in a non-production environment first
- Verify both new user onboarding and existing user authentication flows
- Test edge cases like users with special characters in identifiers
- Validate that user permissions and data sync correctly after authentication
