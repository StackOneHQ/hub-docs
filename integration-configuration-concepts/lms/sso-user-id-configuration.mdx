## Overview

Learning Management System (LMS) integrations often require mapping users between your Identity Provider (IdP) and the LMS platform. This mapping is typically achieved through a custom SSO attribute called `lms_user_id` that contains the user's identifier in the target LMS system.

This document provides an overview of the concepts and links to specific Identity Provider configuration guides.

## Key Concepts

### User Identity Mapping

When a user logs into an LMS through SSO, the system needs to:

1. **Authenticate the user** through your Identity Provider
2. **Receive user attributes** in the SAML assertion or OIDC claims
3. **Map the user** to an existing LMS account using the `lms_user_id` attribute
4. **Grant access** to the appropriate LMS resources

### Common User ID Patterns

Different LMS platforms expect different identifier formats:

| ID Type | Description | Example | Common LMS Platforms |
|---------|-------------|---------|---------------------|
| **Email Address** | User's email address | `john.doe@company.edu` | Blackboard, some Canvas instances |
| **Employee ID** | Numeric employee identifier | `123456` | Cornerstone, Docebo, Workday Learning |
| **Student ID** | Academic student identifier | `STU789123` | Canvas, Moodle (academic) |
| **Username** | Login username | `jdoe` | Moodle, custom LMS platforms |
| **External ID** | External system identifier | `EXT_ABC123` | Multi-system integrations |

### SSO Protocols

Most LMS integrations use one of two SSO protocols:

**SAML 2.0 (Recommended)**
- More secure for enterprise environments
- Better support for custom attributes
- Standard protocol across most enterprise IdPs

**OpenID Connect (OIDC)**
- Modern OAuth 2.0-based protocol
- Good for cloud-native applications
- Flexible claim structure

### Other Popular Identity Providers

If your Identity Provider isn't listed above, the general principles remain the same:

1. **Create/configure** a SAML application or OIDC client
2. **Add custom attributes** or claims for `lms_user_id`
3. **Map user attributes** to the LMS identifier
4. **Test the configuration** with sample users
5. **Deploy to production** with proper access controls

## Planning Your Implementation

### Step 1: Identify LMS User Identifiers

Before configuring your IdP, determine:

- **What identifier format** does your LMS use?
- **Where is this identifier stored** in your user directory?
- **Is the identifier unique** across all users?
- **Does it change over time** (avoid changing identifiers)?

### Step 2: Choose User Attribute Source

Common sources for `lms_user_id`:

**Existing Attributes:**
- Employee ID (for staff/faculty)
- Student ID (for academic institutions)
- Email address (universal but may change)
- Username (if stable and unique)

**Custom Attributes:**
- LMS-specific identifiers
- External system IDs
- Composite identifiers

### Step 3: Configure Identity Provider

Follow the appropriate guide above to:

1. Set up the SSO application
2. Configure custom attributes/claims
3. Map to your chosen user identifier
4. Set up user access and permissions

### Step 4: Test Configuration

Always test your configuration:

1. **Validate SSO response** contains the correct `lms_user_id`
2. **Test user mapping** in the LMS
3. **Verify edge cases** (new users, missing attributes, etc.)
4. **Check error handling** for failed mappings

## Security Considerations

### Attribute Security

- **Minimize sensitive data** in SSO attributes
- **Use stable identifiers** that don't change frequently
- **Encrypt assertions** when possible (SAML)
- **Validate user input** before using in attributes

### Access Control

- **Limit application access** to authorized users only
- **Use organizational units** or groups to control access
- **Implement conditional access** policies where supported
- **Monitor authentication events** regularly

### Data Privacy

- **Only include necessary attributes** in SSO responses
- **Follow data protection regulations** (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- **Document attribute usage** and retention policies
- **Provide user transparency** about data sharing

## Common Implementation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: University Environment

**Users**: Students, Faculty, Staff
**Identifier**: Student ID for students, Employee ID for staff
**Implementation**:
- Use organizational units or groups to differentiate user types
- Map different attributes based on user type
- Include role/group information in SSO response

### Scenario 2: Corporate Training

**Users**: All employees
**Identifier**: Employee ID
**Implementation**:
- Single attribute mapping for all users
- Include department/role information
- Sync with HR systems for user lifecycle management

### Scenario 3: Multi-Tenant SaaS

**Users**: Multiple customer organizations
**Identifier**: Tenant-specific user ID
**Implementation**:
- Include tenant information in attributes
- Use composite identifiers (tenant + user ID)
- Separate SSO applications per tenant if needed

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### User Not Found in LMS

**Causes:**
- `lms_user_id` doesn't match LMS user identifier
- Case sensitivity issues
- User doesn't exist in LMS yet
- Identifier format mismatch

**Solutions:**
- Verify identifier format and case
- Check LMS user provisioning
- Review attribute mapping configuration
- Test with known working users

### Custom Attribute Not Appearing

**Causes:**
- User doesn't have the attribute populated
- Incorrect attribute mapping
- IdP configuration issues
- SSO application not assigned to user

**Solutions:**
- Verify user attribute data
- Check IdP attribute mapping
- Review application assignments
- Test SSO response directly

### Authentication Failures

**Causes:**
- Incorrect SSO URLs or certificates
- SAML configuration mismatch
- Token/assertion format issues
- Network or firewall blocks

**Solutions:**
- Verify SSO configuration details
- Check certificate validity
- Review error messages and logs
- Test network connectivity

## Best Practices

### Configuration Management

- **Use version control** for IdP configurations when possible
- **Document attribute mappings** and business logic
- **Maintain staging environments** for testing
- **Plan for disaster recovery** and backup configurations

### User Experience

- **Provide clear error messages** for failed logins
- **Offer alternative authentication** methods as fallback
- **Test user journeys** regularly
- **Monitor authentication performance**

### Maintenance

- **Regularly review user attributes** for accuracy
- **Monitor for deprecated features** in your IdP
- **Update certificates** before expiration
- **Review access permissions** periodically
