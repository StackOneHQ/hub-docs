If you've been directed to integrate with Slack, the following steps will help you configure the required OAuth application details so you can connect successfully.

## Create a Slack app and configure OAuth

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Slack app">
    Go to [Slack API: Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and create a new app (for example, **From scratch**).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the redirect URL">
    In your app settings, open **OAuth &amp; Permissions** and add this **Redirect URL**:
    `https://api.stackone.com/connect/oauth2/slack/callback`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the required scopes">
    In **OAuth &amp; Permissions**, add the scopes required by your integration (you can adjust these later if needed).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install the app to your workspace">
    Install the app to the Slack workspace you want to connect so the OAuth authorization flow can be completed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy your Client ID and Client Secret">
    In **Basic Information**, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and store them safely.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Linking your Slack account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter connection details">
    In your integration platform, paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the previous steps (and any optional scopes/settings required for your use case).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authorize access in Slack">
    Start the OAuth flow and approve access when prompted by Slack.
  </Step>
</Steps>
