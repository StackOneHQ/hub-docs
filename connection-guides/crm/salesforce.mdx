If you've been directed to StackOne to integrate with Salesforce, the following steps will help you understand the process and any necessary actions to configure successful integration.

## Generating your API credentials

  <Step title="Select OAuth Scopes">
    Under Selected OAuth Scopes, you should select the following entries:

## Troubleshooting

### Error: The REST API is not enabled for this Organization

This error message indicates that the account you have used to connect to Salesforce does not have API access enabled. This is based on the edition you are using (see [here](https://help.salesforce.com) for a description of the editions). The Developer Edition has API access, and an account with this profile should be used.

### Error: invalid_client_id when linking the account

If you receive an error when linking accounts similar to the following:
<code>error=invalid_client_id&error_description=client%20identifier%20invalid</code>
It can indicate that the Salesforce side still needs to be updated. Although Salesforce quotes up to 10 minutes after generating credentials for this to work, we have observed this taking up to 20 minutes to take effect. Please wait and try again.
