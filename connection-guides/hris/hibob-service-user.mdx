## Creating a new Service User

  <Step title="Finish Creation">
    Click Done to complete the Service User creation process.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Access Permissions for the Service User

The newly created Service User account initially has no access permissions. You'll need to set up permissions to enable data retrieval. We recommend following HiBob's guide for creating permission groups:

[Creating a Custom Permissions Group](https://help.hibob.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409776408209-Create-a-custom-permission-group)

Once you've created a permissions group or if you already have one configured, add your new Service User to this group.

Ensure the following permissions are enabled:

*In the `Features` tab*
<Accordion title="People">
<Frame>
  <img className='rounded-md' style={{ margin: '0 auto', border: '1px solid #efefef' }} alt="Feature permission for its People subsection" src="/images/hibob-service-user/image_features_tab.png" />
