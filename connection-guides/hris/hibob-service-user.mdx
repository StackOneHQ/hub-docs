If you've been directed to StackOne to integrate with Hibob, the following steps will help you understand the process and any necessary actions to configure successful integration.

## Creating a new Service User

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Service Users">
    Using the left menu, select Settings > Integrations, select Automation under Categories. Click Manage under the Service Users Icon.

    <Frame>
      <img className='rounded-md' style={{ margin: '0 auto', border: '1px solid #efefef' }} alt="Service Users" src="/images/hibob-service-user/image1.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create New Service User">
    Click on the New Service User button.

    <Frame>
      <img className='rounded-md' style={{ margin: '0 auto', border: '1px solid #efefef' }} alt="New Service User" src="/images/hibob-service-user/image2.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fill in Details">

    <Frame>
      <img className='rounded-md' style={{ margin: '0 auto', border: '1px solid #efefef' }} alt="Fill Details" src="/images/hibob-service-user/image3.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy Service User ID and Token">
    Copy Service User ID and Token to a safe place, since the token cannot be retrieved after this. However, the token can be reset and a new one created.

    <Frame>
      <img className='rounded-md' style={{ margin: '0 auto', border: '1px solid #efefef' }} alt="Service User ID and Token" src="/images/hibob-service-user/image4.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Finish Creation">
    Click Done and the Service User is created.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Access permissions for the Service User

The newly created Service User account has no access permissions, so you won't be able to retrieve data. Creating Permissions Groups is an additional process that is best described by Hibob:

[Creating a Custom Permissions Group](https://help.hibob.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409776408209-Create-a-custom-permission-group)

Once you have a permissions group for your service users, or already have a permissions group set up, you can add your new Service User to this group.
