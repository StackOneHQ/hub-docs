## Finding your Workday Tenant

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log into Workday">
    Log into your Workday account. Look at the address bar at the top of the browser window where the URL is displayed. Find your tenant immediately after `workday.com/`.

    For example, if your URL is `https://my-instance.workday.com/my-tenant/d/etc`, your tenant is `my-tenant`.

    <Frame>
      <img
        className="rounded-md"
        style={{ margin:"0 auto",border:"1px solid #efefef" }}
        alt="Workday Tenant"
        src="/images/workday-oauth2/image1.png"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Finding the Web Services Endpoint

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Public Web Services">
    Go to the `Public Web Services` report.

    <Frame>
      <img className='rounded-md' style={{ margin: '0 auto', border: '1px solid #efefef' }} alt="Human Resources Web Service" src="/images/workday/image2.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Human Resources">
    Find Human Resources and hover over it to be able to interact with the menu. Via the three-dots menu, go to `Web Service` and click on `View WSDL` (note that the page may take a minute to fully load).

    <Frame>
      <img className='rounded-md' style={{ margin: '0 auto', border: '1px solid #efefef' }} alt="WSDL Service" src="/images/workday/image3.png" />
    </Frame>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Search for wsdl:service">
    Search for `wsdl:service` in the file OR navigate directly to the very bottom of the page. You should see something like this:

    <Frame>
      <img className='rounded-md' style={{ margin: '0 auto', border: '1px solid #efefef' }} alt="WSDL Service" src="/images/workday/image4.png" />
    </Frame>

    Copy everything before `service` in the location attribute. Do not include the `https://` prefix. In the example tenant above, this would be `wd2-impl-services1.workday.com/ccx` but it may be different for your tenant (e.g., `wd5-services1.myworkday.com/ccx`).

    Save this value to be used in a later step.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Set up an Integration System User

<Steps>
  <Step title="Search for Create Integration System User">
    Log in to your Workday tenant in the Workday portal. In the Search field, search for "Create Integration System User".

        src="/images/workday/image5.png"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

## Configure Domain Security Policy Permissions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Edit Permissions">
    <Info>
      The Workday HRIS integration currently requires **all** of the permissions listed below to be enabled for full support.

      Workday's API may return an error response if any of these permissions are missing.
    </Info>
    Edit the Domain Security Policy Permissions in the Security Group.

    You can reach this interface by searching for "Maintain Permissions for Security Group" in the search bar, and selecting the name of the Security Group you created in the previous step.

    This integration uses the following Workday Security Group Permissions. For each listed permission, add a row for either **Get Only** for read-only access, or **Get and Put** for read and write access in the _View/Modify Access_ column. 

    <Note>
      "View" access may be required for accessing Custom Report and WQL data.
    </Note>

    <Frame>
      <img
        className="rounded-md"

        src="/images/workday/image13.png"

## Edit Required Business Process Security Policies

<Steps>

  <Note>
    Initiation Access for the Request Time Off business process is required by default to access some Worker Time Off data.

    Your tenant may require similar View Access for other business processes.
  </Note>

  <Step title="Edit Required Business Process Security Policies">
    Open the "Edit Business Process Security Policy" task for the "Request Time Off" business process.

    <Frame>
      <img
        className="rounded-md"

      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Grant Initiation Access">
    Under "Who Can Start the Business Process" > "Initiating Action: Request Time Off (REST Service)", add the Security Group you created in the previous steps.

    Then click OK.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Approve the Security Policy Changes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Search for Activate Pending Security Policy Changes">
    In the Search bar, search for "Activate Pending Security Policy Changes". Review the policies that need approval in the summary of the changes in the security policy. Approve the pending security policy changes to activate them.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Identifying and Troubleshooting Additional Required Permissions

<Info>
  The API client accesses Workday using the permissions of the Integration System User that is linked via the refresh token. The Integration System User's permissions are determined by the User-Based Security Group you created and assigned to that user (and any others assigned). If you encounter API errors related to missing permissions, you may need to identify and add additional permissions to this Security Group.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Troubleshooting REST Endpoint and Report Field Access">
    If you receive API errors indicating that a specific REST endpoint or report field is inaccessible, you can identify the required permissions using the "View Security for Securable Item" report.

    <Note>
      This report allows you to search for Tasks, Reports, Report Fields, Background Processes, and Data Sources to view their required Functional Areas, Security Policies, and currently-permitted Security Groups.
    </Note>

    1. In the Search bar, search for "View Security for Securable Item".
    2. In the modal, search for the specific REST endpoint, report, or report field that is causing the error (e.g., search for "Leave Type" if you're getting an error about the `leaveType` field).
    3. From the search results, click the "View Security" button for the relevant item.
       - There are often multiple items with the same name, so you may need to click the "View Security" button for each item.
    4. Review the "Domain Security" section to see which Security Groups currently have access.
    5. Check if your User-Based Security Group is listed. If it is not listed:
       - Note the required Domain Security Policy permissions shown in the modal.
       - Navigate to "Maintain Permissions for Security Group" and add the required permissions to your Security Group.
       - After adding permissions, activate the changes using "Activate Pending Security Policy Changes".
  </Step>

  <Step title="Troubleshooting Calculated Field Access">
    For calculated fields used in reports, you must check the security requirements using the "View Calculated Field" report.

    1. In the Search bar, search for "View Calculated Field".
    2. Search for the specific calculated field that is causing access issues.
    3. Open the calculated field and open the three-dots menu to navigate to "Security" > "View Security".
    4. Review the modal to see:
       - The Security Groups currently permitted to access the calculated field.
       - The Security Policies that are required for access.
    5. If your User-Based Security Group is not listed:
       - Note the required Security Policies shown in the modal.
       - Navigate to "Maintain Permissions for Security Group" and add the required Domain Security Policy permissions to your Security Group.
       - After adding permissions, activate the changes using "Activate Pending Security Policy Changes".
  </Step>
</Steps>
