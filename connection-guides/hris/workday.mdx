## Finding your Workday Tenant

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log into Workday">
    Log into your Workday account. Look at the address bar at the top of the browser window where the URL is displayed. Find your tenant immediately after `workday.com/`.

    For example, if your URL is `https://my-instance.workday.com/my-tenant/d/etc`, your tenant is `my-tenant`.

      <img className='rounded-md' style={{ margin: '0 auto', border: '1px solid #efefef' }} alt="Workday Tenant" src="/images/workday/image1.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Finding the Web Services Endpoint

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Public Web Services">
    Go to the `Public Web Services` report.

    <Frame>
      <img className='rounded-md' style={{ margin: '0 auto', border: '1px solid #efefef' }} alt="Human Resources Web Service" src="/images/workday/image2.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Human Resources">
    Find Human Resources and hover over it to be able to interact with the menu. Via the three-dots menu, go to `Web Service` and click on `View WSDL` (note that the page may take a minute to fully load).

    <Frame>
      <img className='rounded-md' style={{ margin: '0 auto', border: '1px solid #efefef' }} alt="WSDL Service" src="/images/workday/image3.png" />
    </Frame>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Search for wsdl:service">
    Search for `wsdl:service` in the file OR navigate directly to the very bottom of the page. You should see something like this:

    <Frame>
      <img className='rounded-md' style={{ margin: '0 auto', border: '1px solid #efefef' }} alt="WSDL Service" src="/images/workday/image4.png" />
    </Frame>

    Copy everything before `service` in the location attribute. Do not include the `https://` prefix. In the example tenant above, this would be `wd2-impl-services1.workday.com/ccx` but it may be different for your tenant (e.g., `wd5-services1.myworkday.com/ccx`).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Set up an Integration System User

## Configure Domain Security Policy Permissions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Edit Permissions">

    <Info>
      The Workday HRIS integration currently requires **all** of the permissions listed below to be enabled for full support. 

      Workday's API may return an error response if any of these permissions are missing.
    </Info>

    Edit the Domain Security Policy Permissions in the Security Group. 

    You can reach this interface by searching for "Maintain Permissions for Security Group" in the search bar, and selecting the name of the Security Group you created in the previous step.
    
    This integration uses the following Workday Security Group Permissions. For each listed permission, select either **Get Only** for read-only access, or **Get and Put** for read and write access in the *View/Modify Access* column.

    <Frame>
      <img className='rounded-md' style={{ margin: '0 auto', border: '1px solid #efefef' }} alt="View/Modify Access" src="/images/workday/image13.png" />
    </Frame>

    <Info>
      Please note that Security Group Permissions can be customized within a Workday organization, and this list does not account for such customizations.
