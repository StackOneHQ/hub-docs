## Create New OAuth Service Credentials

This connection will authenticate on behalf of registered OAuth credentials in Databricks.

Follow the steps detailed in this [Databricks documentation page](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/oauth-m2m.html#authenticate-access-to-databricks-with-a-service-principal-using-oauth-oauth-m2mn) to:

1. Create a *Service Principal* with *Admin* permissions. Enter `https://api.stackone.com/connect/oauth2/databricks_iam/callback` as the **Redirect URI**
2. Generate an *OAuth Secret*, containing your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** 

Please note that the documented steps will depend on your assigned account role within Databricks.

Copy and store your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** securely to be used in the next step.

## Connecting with StackOne

Upon reaching the Link Account page, enter the credentials from the previous steps:
- **Account ID**

- **Client Secret**
