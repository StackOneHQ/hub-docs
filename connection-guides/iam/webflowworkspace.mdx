If you've been directed to StackOne to integrate with Webflow, the following steps will help you understand the process and any necessary actions to configure a successful integration.

## Log in to Webflow 

Log in to your Webflow app at https://webflow.com/login

## Get Your Webflow Workspace ID

One Webflow IAM connection will be associated with a single Webflow workspace. 

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Your Workspace">
    In the Webflow Dashboard, click the Workspace drop-down on the left. Select the workspace you wish to connect.

      <img className='rounded-md' style={{ margin: '0 auto', border: '1px solid #efefef' }} alt="All sites" src="/images/webflowworkspace/image1.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy Workspace ID">
    Your **Workspace ID** can now be found in the URL. 
    
    Given the URL: `https://webflow.com/dashboard?workspace=my-workspace`
    
    The **Workspace ID** is *my-workspace*. Copy and store this for use in a later step.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Get Your Two-Factor Authentication (TOTP) Secret

This step is required if Two-Factor Authentication is enabled on your Webflow account.

Follow [Webflow's instructions](https://help.webflow.com/hc/en-us/articles/33961343631891-Two-factor-authentication-2FA#how-to-set-up-two-factor-authentication) for configuring Two-Factor Authentication.

Your **TOTP Secret** (Time-based one-time password secret) will be displayed when enabling Two-Factor Authentication. Copy and store this for use in a later step.
