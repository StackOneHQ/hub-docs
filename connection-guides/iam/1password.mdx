<Note>
  Administrator access is required in your account to manage API credentials and settings.
</Note>

If you've been directed to StackOne to integrate with 1Password, the following steps will help you understand the process and any necessary actions to configure successful integration.

## Introduction
1Password requires account holders to deploy an independent SCIM Bridge to support User data and provisioning via API.

Learn more about the setup requirements and deployment process in [1Password Support](https://support.1password.com/scim/). An Identity Provider (IDP) is not required to configure this integration, but note that the SCIM Bridge setup may vary for connection with different IDPs.

Your SCIM Bridge must be fully configured for this integration. You can check the status of your SCIM bridge at `your-scim-bridge-url/app/status`.

<Warning>
  **Google Workspace** limitation: 1Password currently does not support IAM API endpoints for SCIM Bridges connected to Google Workspace for User Provisioning.

  As a workaround, a second 1Password SCIM Bridge can be deployed to service this IAM connection.
  
  This second SCIM Bridge must use the same *scimsession* file, and must not be connected to Google Workspace.
</Warning>

## Enable 1Password User Provisioning

<Steps>
    <Step title="Log in to your 1Password dashboard">
        Log in to your [1Password account](https://my.1password.com/signin) with your Administrator credentials.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Enable User Provisioning">
        Navigate to Integrations, and select your listed Identity Provider to proceed. If you do not wish to connect to an IDP, select Okta to be used as the default.

        </Frame>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Set up User Provisioning">
        Based on how your SCIM Bridge will be deployed, select the listed deployment method, then click the Next button.
        <Frame>
            <img className='rounded-md' style={{ margin: '0 auto', border: '1px solid #efefef' }} alt="Set Up User Provisioning" src="/images/1password/image2.png" />
        </Frame>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Save Credentials">
        Download and save your **scimsession** file securely, which will be used when deploying your SCIM Bridge to connect with 1Password.

        Download and store your **bearer token** securely, which both an IDP and this integration will use to connect to the SCIM Bridge.

            <img className='rounded-md' style={{ margin: '0 auto', border: '1px solid #efefef' }} alt="Save Credentials" src="/images/1password/image3.png" />
        </Frame>

        If needed, click the button for your deployment type and follow the instructions to deploy.

        Press the Next button to proceed.
    </Step>

    <Step title="(optional) Set up Health Monitoring">
        1Password offers an optional alert system to notify you connection issues with your SCIM Bridge.
        
        To set up, enable "Turn on health monitoring" and enter the publicly-addressable URL for your SCIM Bridge deployment.
        
        Click the Next button to proceed.

        <Frame>
            <img className='rounded-md' style={{ margin: '0 auto', border: '1px solid #efefef' }} alt="Health Monitoring" src="/images/1password/image4.png" />
        </Frame>

    </Step>

    <Step title="(optional) Connect your IDP to the SCIM Bridge">
        If you wish to connect an IDP to your SCIM Bridge, click the tile for your IDP to view configuration instructions.

        Click the "View details" button to open the new User Provisioning configuration profile.
    </Step>

    <Step title="User Provisioning Configuration">
        On this page in 1Password, you can adjust multiple User Provisioning settings, generate new credentials, or delete the setup.

    </Step>

</Steps>

## Deploy 1Password SCIM Bridge

<Steps>

  <Step title="Set up your 1Password SCIM Bridge">
    See 1Password's official [SCIM Bridge deployment examples repo](https://github.com/1Password/scim-examples) for specific setup instructions across different deployment options.

    This will require the **scimsession** file generated from enabling User Provision in your 1Password account.

    Note the publicly-addressable URL (example: `https://op-scim.mydomain.org`) of this deployment, as it is required for establishing this connection.
  </Step>
