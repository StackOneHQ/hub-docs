<Warning>
  Ensure you have Administrator privileges within your 1Password account.
</Warning>

If you're connecting 1Password through StackOne, follow these steps to configure your integration successfully.

## Introduction
1Password requires account holders to deploy an independent SCIM Bridge to support user data and provisioning via the API.

Learn more about the setup requirements and deployment process in [1Password Support](https://support.1password.com/scim/). An Identity Provider (IdP) is not required to configure this integration. However, note that the SCIM Bridge setup may vary depending on your IdP connection.

Your SCIM Bridge must be fully configured before proceeding with this integration. You can check the status of your SCIM Bridge at `your-scim-bridge-url/app/status`.

<Warning>
  **Google Workspace** limitation: 1Password currently does not support IAM API endpoints for SCIM Bridges connected to Google Workspace for User Provisioning.

  As a workaround, you can deploy a second 1Password SCIM Bridge to service this IAM connection.
  
  This second SCIM Bridge must use the same *scimsession* file and must not be connected to Google Workspace.
</Warning>

## Enable 1Password User Provisioning

<Steps>
    <Step title="Log in to your 1Password dashboard">
        Log in to your [1Password account](https://my.1password.com/signin) with your Administrator credentials.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Enable User Provisioning">
        Navigate to Integrations and select your listed Identity Provider to proceed. If you do not wish to connect to an IdP, select Okta as the default option.

        </Frame>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Set up User Provisioning">
        Select your preferred deployment method based on your SCIM Bridge deployment requirements, then click Next.

        </Frame>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Save Credentials">
        1. Download and securely store your **scimsession** file. You'll need this when deploying your SCIM Bridge to connect with 1Password.

        2. Download and securely store your **bearer token**. Both your IdP and this integration will use this token to connect to the SCIM Bridge.

        If needed, click the button for your deployment type and follow the deployment instructions.

        Click Next to continue.
    </Step>

    <Step title="(Optional) Set up Health Monitoring">
        1Password offers an optional alert system to notify you of connection issues with your SCIM Bridge.
        
        To enable this feature:
        1. Toggle "Turn on health monitoring"
        2. Enter the publicly-addressable URL for your SCIM Bridge deployment
        
        Click Next to proceed.

        </Frame>

    </Step>

    <Step title="(Optional) Connect your IdP to the SCIM Bridge">
        To connect an IdP to your SCIM Bridge:
        1. Click the tile for your IdP to view configuration instructions
        2. Click "View details" to open the new User Provisioning configuration profile
    </Step>

    <Step title="User Provisioning Configuration">
        On this page in 1Password, you can:
        - Adjust User Provisioning settings
        - Generate new credentials
        - Delete the setup

## Deploy 1Password SCIM Bridge

<Steps>

  <Step title="Set up your 1Password SCIM Bridge">
    Visit 1Password's official [SCIM Bridge deployment examples repository](https://github.com/1Password/scim-examples) for specific setup instructions across different deployment options.

    Requirements:
    - The **scimsession** file generated when enabling User Provisioning in your 1Password account
    - A publicly-addressable URL for your deployment (example: `https://op-scim.mydomain.org`). You'll need this URL to establish the connection.
  </Step>
