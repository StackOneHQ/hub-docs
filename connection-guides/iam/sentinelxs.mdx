<Warning>
  Ensure you have Administrator privileges for your Sentinel system to configure the external web service integration.
</Warning>

If you've been directed to StackOne to integrate with Sentinel XS, the following steps will help you understand the process and any necessary actions to configure successful integration.

Sentinel XS provides a comprehensive collection of SOAP Web Services that allow external applications to query, add, and manipulate information contained in the Sentinel database.

## Get Your Sentinel XS Web Service Endpoint

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Sentinel Administration">
    Log in to your Sentinel system and navigate to the Administrator section.

    The Sentinel XS Web Service endpoint URL typically follows this format:
    - `https://{{your-sentinel-server}}/SentinelXS/SentinelXS.asmx`
    
    The Web Service Endpoint URL is the URL without the `/SentinelXS/SentinelXS.asmx` extension. 
    
    Your specific endpoint URL may vary depending on your Sentinel installation. Contact your Sentinel administrator if you need assistance locating the web service endpoint URL.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create or Locate Service Account">
    <Warning>It is recommended that you set up a dedicated service account for integration purposes.</Warning>
    
    Navigate to the Users and Permissions section in the Sentinel Administrator area. Create a new user account specifically for API integration, or identify an existing service account that has the necessary permissions to access the Sentinel database via the web service.
    
    Ensure the service account has the necessary permissions to:
    - Access the Sentinel XS Web Service
    - Query and manipulate data in the Sentinel database as required
    - Perform the specific operations needed for your integration
    
    Consult your Sentinel administrator or documentation for specific permission requirements.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Record Credentials">
    Make note of the following information:
    - **Username**: The service account username
    - **Password**: The service account password
    - **Web Service Endpoint URL**: The URL to the Sentinel XS Web Service endpoint (without the `/SentinelXS/SentinelXS.asmx` extension)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Linking your Provider Account

Now that you have all the required information, you can link your account.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter Connection Details">
    Fill in the required fields with the information you gathered:
    - **Web Service Endpoint URL**: Enter the URL to your Sentinel XS Web Service endpoint (without the `/SentinelXS/SentinelXS.asmx` extension)
    - **Username**: Enter the service account username
    - **Password**: Enter the service account password
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test and Save">
    Click Test Connection to verify the connection, then click Save to complete the integration.
  </Step>
