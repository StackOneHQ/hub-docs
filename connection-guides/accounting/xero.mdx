    <Step title="Sign in to Xero">

        </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Authorize the Application">
        After successful login, Xero will display an authorization page showing the permissions that will be granted and ask you to select the organization you want to connect. (See note below to connect additional organizations after the first connection.)
        <Frame>
            ![](/images/xero/image4.png)
        </Frame>
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Connect additional organizations

If you have access to multiple Xero organizations, you can connect additional organizations after the first connection:

- Follow the same steps as the first connection to connect additional organizations.
- When at Step 3, select the additional organization you want to connect.

This should be repeated for each additional organization you want to connect.
