  Ensure you have Admin privileges for your Bullhorn account.
</Warning>

If you've been directed to StackOne to integrate with Bullhorn, the following steps will help you understand the process and any necessary actions to configure a successful integration.

## Getting your Client ID, Client Secret and API Username

These are unique identifiers for your account. If you do not possess this information, please contact Bullhorn Support or Submit a ticket via the [Bullhorn Resource Center](https://www.bullhorn.com/au/technical-support-2/)

You will need to contact Bullhorn support to "add the following redirect URI: `https://api.stackone.com/connect/oauth2/bullhorn_ats/callback`".

## Identify a Bullhorn Custom Field for Data Storage

This connection will store Background Check and Assessment information within a custom field in Bullhorn. To avoid overwriting existing data, please identify an unused custom field in your Bullhorn instance.

You will be able to select `customTextBlock` 1 through 10 for this "Custom Field" in the connection step below.

_Example_: `customTextBlock4`

## (optional) Getting a Client Corporation ID and Client Contact ID

To create a new Job with this connection, a **Client Corporation ID** (Company ID) and **Client Contact ID** are required to be associated with the new Job.

The **Client Corporation ID** can be seen in the main _Companies_ page in your Bullhorn instance:

The **Client Contact ID** can be seen by viewing the _Contacts_ of the same Company you will be using for this step.
