## Overview

Brainier is a comprehensive Learning Management System (LMS) that provides enterprise-level training solutions. To use the Brainier Integration, you'll need to create an API Client and configure OAuth 2.0 authentication.

<Warning>
You need **Admin** privileges in your Brainier account to complete this integration. If you don't have admin access, please contact your Brainier administrator.
</Warning>

## Create an API Client

To authenticate with the Brainier Elan REST API using OAuth 2.0, you must first create an API Client.

<Steps>

<Step title="Access API Client Management">
Log in to your Brainier LMS site and navigate to:
**Admin** > **Settings** > **Options** > **Integrations** > **Elan REST API** > **Manage API Clients**
</Step>

<Step title="Create New API Client">
Click the **Add** button in the top right corner of the screen.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure API Client Settings">
Fill out the following fields:

- **Client Name**: Enter a descriptive name for this API Client (e.g., "StackOne Integration")
- **Token Duration (minutes)**: Set the access token validity period in minutes (maximum: 1440 or 24 hours)
- **Scopes**: Select the groups of API methods this client is allowed to access. For StackOne integration, ensure you select scopes that include:
  - `groups`
  - `users`
  - Any additional scopes required for your specific use case
</Step>

<Step title="Save and Retrieve Credentials">
Click **Save** to create the API Client. After saving, two new fields will appear:

- **Client ID**: A unique identifier for this API Client
- **Client Secret**: A secret value used for obtaining access tokens

<Warning>
Store the **Client Secret** in a secure location. This value should never be exposed to front-end code or shared publicly.
</Warning>
</Step>

</Steps>

## Gather Required Information

Before linking your Brainier account with StackOne, you'll need to collect the following information:

<Steps>

<Step title="Subdomain">
Your Brainier subdomain is the first part of your Brainier URL.

For example, if your Brainier URL is `https://mycompany.brainier.com`, your subdomain is `mycompany`.
</Step>

<Step title="Client ID and Client Secret">
These are the credentials you obtained when creating the API Client in the previous section.
</Step>

<Step title="Username">
Identify the username of the account you want to bind the access token to. This is typically a SuperAdmin account or a dedicated service account with appropriate permissions.

<Note>
If no username is supplied during authentication, the token will be bound to the default SuperAdmin account (user_id 1).
</Note>
</Step>

</Steps>

## Linking your Brainier Account

Now that you have all the required information, you can link your Brainier account.

<Steps>
<Step title="Enter Connection Details">
Fill in the following fields with the information you gathered:

- **Subdomain**: Enter your Brainier subdomain (without the `.brainier.com` part)
- **Client ID**: Enter the Client ID from your API Client
- **Client Secret**: Enter the Client Secret from your API Client
- **Username**: Enter the username for the account to bind the token to (optional)
</Step>

<Step title="Test and Save">
Click **Test Connection** to verify that the credentials are correct.
</Step>

</Steps>

## SSO Configuration

Proper SSO (Single Sign-On) configuration is essential for the Brainier integration to work correctly. The configuration ensures that users are properly identified and matched between your platform and Brainier.

<Warning>
  Before configuring SSO, check the authentication approach with your content provider to ensure compatibility and proper user mapping.
</Warning>

### Configuration Options

The SSO configuration should use the following approach:

#### Custom Field Configuration
<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Custom Field">
    Configure a custom field called `lms_user_id` and set it to the **User ID** field value.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Custom Field">
    Ensure the `lms_user_id` custom field is properly populated and accessible through the SSO configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Important:** Misconfigured SSO settings can result in users being unable to access their learning content or receiving incorrect learning records. Always verify the field mapping is accurate.
</Warning>

### Customer Responsibility

- Ensure the User ID field is correctly populated in your user management system
- Verify that the SSO configuration matches the authentication method used by Brainier
- Test the SSO flow with a small group of users before full deployment

## Content Visibility

In order for a user to be able to view content either on the UI or in the API, they need to be assigned to the content. This can be done directly or by bring
part of a group which has access.

The suggested approach is to ensure content is correctly assigned to the users/groups that will have visibility and will need access, otherwise they may be refused access to the content.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the integration process, check the following:

<Steps>

<Step title="Invalid Credentials">
**Error**: `invalid_client`

**Solution**: Verify that your Client ID and Client Secret are correct and haven't been modified. Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters.
</Step>

<Step title="Invalid Username">
**Error**: `invalid_username`

**Solution**: The username you provided doesn't exist in your Brainier LMS. Either:
- Leave the username field empty to use the default SuperAdmin account
- Verify the username exists in your Brainier system
</Step>

<Step title="Insufficient Permissions">
**Error**: Access denied or scope errors

**Solution**: Ensure the API Client has been configured with all necessary scopes, including `groups` and `users`. You may need to edit your API Client in Brainier to add additional scopes.
</Step>

<Step title="Connection Timeout">
**Solution**: 
- Verify your subdomain is correct
- Check if your Brainier instance is accessible from external networks
- Ensure there are no firewall rules blocking API access
</Step>

</Steps>
