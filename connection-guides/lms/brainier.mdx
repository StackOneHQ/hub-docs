## Overview

Brainier is a comprehensive Learning Management System (LMS) that provides enterprise-level training solutions. To use the Brainier Integration, you'll need to create an API Client and configure OAuth 2.0 authentication.

<Warning>
You need **Admin** privileges in your Brainier account to complete this integration. If you don't have admin access, please contact your Brainier administrator.
</Warning>

## Create an API Client

To authenticate with the Brainier Elan REST API using OAuth 2.0, you must first create an API Client.

<Steps>

<Step title="Access API Client Management">
Log in to your Brainier LMS site and navigate to:
**Admin** > **Settings** > **Options** > **Integrations** > **Elan REST API** > **Manage API Clients**
</Step>

<Step title="Create New API Client">
Click the **Add** button in the top right corner of the screen.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure API Client Settings">
Fill out the following fields:

- **Client Name**: Enter a descriptive name for this API Client (e.g., "StackOne Integration")
- **Token Duration (minutes)**: Set the access token validity period in minutes (maximum: 1440 or 24 hours)
- **Scopes**: Select the groups of API methods this client is allowed to access. For StackOne integration, ensure you select scopes that include:
  - `groups`
  - `users`
  - Any additional scopes required for your specific use case
</Step>

<Step title="Save and Retrieve Credentials">
Click **Save** to create the API Client. After saving, two new fields will appear:

- **Client ID**: A unique identifier for this API Client
- **Client Secret**: A secret value used for obtaining access tokens

<Warning>
Store the **Client Secret** in a secure location. This value should never be exposed to front-end code or shared publicly.
</Warning>
</Step>

</Steps>

## Gather Required Information

Before linking your Brainier account with StackOne, you'll need to collect the following information:

<Steps>

<Step title="Subdomain">
Your Brainier subdomain is the first part of your Brainier URL.

For example, if your Brainier URL is `https://mycompany.brainier.com`, your subdomain is `mycompany`.
</Step>

<Step title="Client ID and Client Secret">
These are the credentials you obtained when creating the API Client in the previous section.
</Step>

<Step title="Username">
Identify the username of the account you want to bind the access token to. This is typically a SuperAdmin account or a dedicated service account with appropriate permissions.

<Note>
If no username is supplied during authentication, the token will be bound to the default SuperAdmin account (user_id 1).
</Note>
</Step>

</Steps>

## Linking your Brainier Account

Now that you have all the required information, you can link your Brainier account.

<Steps>
<Step title="Enter Connection Details">
Fill in the following fields with the information you gathered:

- **Subdomain**: Enter your Brainier subdomain (without the `.brainier.com` part)
- **Client ID**: Enter the Client ID from your API Client
- **Client Secret**: Enter the Client Secret from your API Client
- **Username**: Enter the username for the account to bind the token to (optional)
</Step>

<Step title="Test and Save">
Click **Test Connection** to verify that the credentials are correct.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the integration process, check the following:

<Steps>

<Step title="Invalid Credentials">
**Error**: `invalid_client`

**Solution**: Verify that your Client ID and Client Secret are correct and haven't been modified. Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters.
</Step>

<Step title="Invalid Username">
**Error**: `invalid_username`

**Solution**: The username you provided doesn't exist in your Brainier LMS. Either:
- Leave the username field empty to use the default SuperAdmin account
- Verify the username exists in your Brainier system
</Step>

<Step title="Insufficient Permissions">
**Error**: Access denied or scope errors

**Solution**: Ensure the API Client has been configured with all necessary scopes, including `groups` and `users`. You may need to edit your API Client in Brainier to add additional scopes.
</Step>

<Step title="Connection Timeout">
**Solution**: 
- Verify your subdomain is correct
- Check if your Brainier instance is accessible from external networks
- Ensure there are no firewall rules blocking API access
</Step>

</Steps>
