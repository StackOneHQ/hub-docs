## JWT Authentication

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find REST Server URL">
    Log into the Oracle dashboard and take the root URL from the address bar.

    E.g. If your url is `https://fa-test-saasfa.fa.ocs.oraclecloud.com/fscmUI/faces/AtkHomePageWelcome?` the REST Server URL is `https://fa-test-saasfa.fa.ocs.oraclecloud.com`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find User Name">
    Follow these steps to find the user name:

  </Step>
  <Step title="Find x509 Certificate">
    Obtain the x509 certificate from your content provider.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Private Key">
    Obtain the private key from your content provider.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### SSO Configuration

Proper SSO (Single Sign-On) configuration is essential for the Oracle integration to work correctly. The configuration ensures that users are properly identified and matched between your platform and Oracle.

#### Primary Configuration: lms_user_id

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set lms_user_id Field">
    Configure a custom field called `lms_user_id` and set it to the **Email or username** field value.
    
    This is the primary and recommended approach for user identification in Oracle.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify lms_user_id Configuration">
    Ensure the `lms_user_id` custom field is properly populated and accessible through the SSO configuration.
    
    Work with your content provider to verify that the field is correctly configured and test the SSO flow.
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### Alternative Configuration Option

If the primary lms_user_id configuration cannot be implemented, the following alternative is available:

##### External Reference Field Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure External Reference Field">
    If the `lms_user_id` custom field cannot be configured to the Email or username, configure an additional field called `lms_external_reference_field` to map to the **personExternalID** field.
    
    This is the fallback option when the primary configuration is not feasible.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Validate External Reference">
    Work with your content provider to ensure the external reference field mapping is correctly implemented and tested.
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### Important Notes

<Warning>
  Correct SSO configuration is **essential** for ensuring the integration works as expected. Incorrect configuration may result in:
  
  - Users not being properly identified
  - Learning records not being correctly attributed
  - Authentication failures
</Warning>

<Note>
  **Customer Responsibility**: You should work closely with your content provider to ensure the SSO configuration follows one of the recommended approaches above. The content provider should validate that the configuration meets the integration requirements.
</Note>

## Linking your Account
