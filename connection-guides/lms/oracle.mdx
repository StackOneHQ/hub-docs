## JWT Authentication

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find REST Server URL">
    Log into the Oracle dashboard and take the root URL from the address bar.

    E.g. If your url is `https://fa-test-saasfa.fa.ocs.oraclecloud.com/fscmUI/faces/AtkHomePageWelcome?` the REST Server URL is `https://fa-test-saasfa.fa.ocs.oraclecloud.com`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find User Name">
    Follow these steps to find the user name:

  </Step>
  <Step title="Find x509 Certificate">
    Obtain the x509 certificate from your content provider.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Private Key">
    Obtain the private key from your content provider.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Linking your Account
<Steps>
  <Step title="Link Oracle Account">

      Click `Connect`.
    </Step>
  </Steps>

## SSO Configuration

Proper SSO (Single Sign-On) configuration is essential for the Oracle integration to work correctly. The configuration ensures that users are properly identified and matched between your platform and Oracle.

<Warning>
  Before configuring SSO, check the authentication approach with your content provider to ensure compatibility and proper user mapping.
</Warning>

### Configuration Options

The SSO configuration should use the following approach:

#### Custom Field Configuration
<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Custom Field">
    Configure a custom field called `lms_user_id` and set it to the **email or username** field value.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Custom Field">
    Ensure the `lms_user_id` custom field is properly populated and accessible through the SSO configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Important:** Misconfigured SSO settings can result in users being unable to access their learning content or receiving incorrect learning records. Always verify the field mapping is accurate.
</Warning>

### Customer Responsibility

- Ensure the email or username field is correctly populated in your user management system
- Verify that the SSO configuration matches the authentication method used by Oracle
- Test the SSO flow with a small group of users before full deployment
