## Troubleshooting

<Steps>
  <Step title="What does it mean when I see the following response from a Cornerstone API: 'Provided user does not have Rest services permissions and/or constrainsts to perform this operation'?">
    This error message indicates that the API you are trying to access is not enabled in your Cornerstone portal. To resolve this error, please follow the below steps:
      1. Navigate to Admin > Tools > Edge > Integrations > Manage APIs within your Cornerstone portal.
      2. Ensure the toggles for Cornerstone API and Reporting API are turned on.
      3. If the toggles are already turned on, try turning them off and then back on again. This action resets the backend settings that control access to Cornerstone's APIs.

    After performing the above steps, if you still see the same error response, please log a case with Cornerstone Global Customer Support (GCS).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Why am I getting a 401 unauthorized response when trying to hit the Reporting API?">
    There are a few things you should check when you receive this response:
    1. Verify that the Reporting API is enable for the environment that you are trying to pull data from. You can do this by navigating to Admin > Tools > Edge > API Management > Manage APIs.
    You should see the Reporting API enabled on this page.
    2. If you are using OAuth 2.0 for your API authentication:
      - Ensure that the user account associated with your registered OAuth 2.0 application has the Reporting API - Read only permission.
      - Ensure that your OAuth 2.0 application has the required scope to access the endpoint that you are trying to retrieve data from.
      - Ensure that the OAuth 2.0 access token is still valid. Remember that OAuth 2.0 access tokens are valid for an hour by default, unelss you set a different validity period for your application in the 
      API Management page in Edge.

    After performing the above steps, if you still see an 'unauthorized access' error, please log a case with Cornerstone Global Customer Support (GCS).
