## Finding your Workday Tenant

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log into Workday">
    Log into your Workday account. Look at the address bar at the top of the browser window where the URL is displayed. Find your tenant immediately after `workday.com/`.

    <Frame>
      <img className='rounded-md' style={{ margin: '0 auto', border: '1px solid #efefef' }} alt="Workday Tenant" src="/images/workday/image1.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Finding the Web Services Endpoint

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Public Web Services">
    Go to the `Public Web Services` report.

    <Frame>
      <img className='rounded-md' style={{ margin: '0 auto', border: '1px solid #efefef' }} alt="Learning Web Service" src="/images/workday/image2.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Learning">
    Find Learning and hover over it to be able to interact with the menu. Via the three-dots menu, go to `Web Service` and click on `View WSDL` (note that the page may take a minute to fully load).

    <Frame>
      <img className='rounded-md' style={{ margin: '0 auto', border: '1px solid #efefef' }} alt="WSDL Service" src="/images/workday/image10.png" />
    </Frame>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Search for wsdl:service">
    Search for `wsdl:service` in the file OR navigate directly to the very bottom of the page. You should see something like this:

      <img className='rounded-md' style={{ margin: '0 auto', border: '1px solid #efefef' }} alt="WSDL Service" src="/images/workday/image11.png" />
    </Frame>

    Copy everything before `service` in the location attribute. Do not include the `https://` prefix. In the example tenant above, this would be `wd2-impl-services1.workday.com/ccx` but it may be different for your tenant (e.g., `wd5-services1.myworkday.com/ccx`).
