## SSO Configuration

Proper SSO (Single Sign-On) configuration is essential for the Cornerstone (1:1 Connector) integration to work correctly. The configuration ensures that users are properly identified and matched between your platform and Cornerstone.

<Warning>
  Before configuring SSO, check the authentication approach with your content provider to ensure compatibility and proper user mapping.
</Warning>

### Configuration Options

The SSO configuration should use the following approach:

#### Custom Field Configuration
<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Custom Field">
    Configure a custom field called `lms_user_id` and set it to the **username or user id** field value.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Custom Field">
    Ensure the `lms_user_id` custom field is properly populated and accessible through the SSO configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Important:** Misconfigured SSO settings can result in users being unable to access their learning content or receiving incorrect learning records. Always verify the field mapping is accurate.
</Warning>

### Customer Responsibility

- Ensure the Username or User ID field is correctly populated in your user management system
- Verify that the SSO configuration matches the authentication method used by Cornerstone
- Test the SSO flow with a small group of users before full deployment
