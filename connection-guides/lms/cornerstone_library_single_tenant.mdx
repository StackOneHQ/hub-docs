### SSO Configuration

Proper SSO (Single Sign-On) configuration is essential for the Cornerstone (1:1 Connector) integration to work correctly. The configuration ensures that users are properly identified and matched between your platform and Cornerstone.

#### NameID Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure NameID Field">
    The NameID in your SSO configuration should be set to the **username or user id** field to ensure proper user identification.
    
    This is the preferred configuration and should be implemented whenever possible.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Configuration">
    Work with your content provider to verify that the NameID is properly configured to use the username or user id field.
    
    Test the SSO flow to ensure users are correctly identified in Cornerstone.
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### Alternative Configuration Options

If the preferred NameID configuration cannot be implemented, the following alternative is available:

##### Custom Field Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Custom Field">
    If setting the NameID to username or user id is not possible, configure a custom field called `lms_user_id` and set it to the **username or user id** field value.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Custom Field">
    Ensure the `lms_user_id` custom field is properly populated and accessible through the SSO configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### Important Notes

<Warning>
  Correct SSO configuration is **essential** for ensuring the integration works as expected. Incorrect configuration may result in:
  
  - Users not being properly identified
  - Learning records not being correctly attributed
  - Authentication failures
</Warning>

<Note>
  **Customer Responsibility**: You should work closely with your content provider to ensure the SSO configuration follows one of the recommended approaches above. The content provider should validate that the configuration meets the integration requirements.
