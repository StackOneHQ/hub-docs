      Hub documentation guides must follow this structure:

      1. File Location:
         - Place directly in connection-guides/{category}/{integration-name}.mdx
         - Use kebab-case for filenames
         - Categories: ats, documents, hris, iam, lms, marketing, screening, crm
         - IMPORTANT: Do NOT place in docs/hubs/{category}/ - place directly in the category folder

      2. Required Frontmatter:
         ```mdx
         ---
         title: "Integration Name"
         description: "Follow these steps to connect {Integration} via the StackOne Hub successfully."
         ---
         ```

      3. Required Imports:
         ```mdx
         import IntegrationFooter from "/snippets/integration-footer.mdx"
         ```

      4. Standard Sections:
         - Warning (if applicable)
         - Introduction paragraph
         - Authentication steps in <Steps> component
         - IntegrationFooter
         - Available data section

      5. Authentication Patterns:
         - OAuth
         - API Key
         - Service Account
         - Partner OAuth
         Each pattern has specific required steps

      6. Image Guidelines:
         - Store in /images/{integration-name}/
         - Use descriptive kebab-case names
         - Include in <Frame> components
         - Add alt text and className

      7. **Link Validation Requirements:**
         - Test ALL external links before adding them to documentation
         - Verify links are accessible and return expected content
         - Check that API documentation links are still valid
         - Ensure provider website links are working
         - Test any download links or resource links
         - If a link is broken, either find an alternative or remove it
         - Consider adding link checking to your documentation workflow

      8. **Linking Section Guidelines:**
         - Use generic language like "your platform" or "the integration platform" instead of "StackOne"
         - Focus on the provider's perspective and what they need to do
         - Avoid mentioning specific product names in the linking steps
         - Example: "Navigate to the Integrations page in your platform" instead of "Navigate to StackOne Hub"

      9. **Integration Index Entry:**
         - After creating a new guide, add an entry in `integrations.mdx` that redirects or links to the new guide.
         - Example:
           ```mdx
           - name: OneDrive
             href: /connection-guides/documents/onedrive
           ```
         - This ensures the new integration is discoverable in the documentation index.

  - type: validate
    conditions:
      - pattern: "- name: [Ii]ntegration\\s*Name\\s*\\n\\s*href: \\/connection-guides\\/[a-z-]+\\/[a-z-]+"
        path: "integrations.mdx"
        message: "A new entry must be added to integrations.mdx with a redirect or link to the new guide."
